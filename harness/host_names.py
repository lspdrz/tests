"""Host names for a local service, as an operator writes them into a setting.

aiohttp resolves a host name through the resolver `AIOHTTP_CLIENT_ASYNC_DNS_RESOLVER` picks (the
threaded OS resolver by default, c-ares through aiodns when it is on) and connects to an IP literal
without asking either, so a test of that switch reaches its fakes by name. A `NameForm` is one way
of naming a local service: `localhost` answers over both address families, `ipv6-only` is a hosts-
file name for `::1` alone and `hosts-file` a hosts-file name for another local address.
`name_forms()` gives the three as pytest params; the last two skip where the machine's hosts file
has no such name. `serving_by_name(form)` starts a `listener` on the form's address and names it by
the form's host. `UNRESOLVABLE` is a name no resolver answers (RFC 6761 reserves `.invalid`); either
resolver refuses it well inside `FAILS_WITHIN` seconds where the DNS server answers, which
`timed(call)` measures. `resolver_reason(text)` is the resolver's own wording of that failure, the
bracketed tail aiohttp ends a connection error with: c-ares words it differently from the OS
(`C_ARES_REASONS`), which is how a test tells which resolver answered. `c_ares_refusal_problem()`
probes once per session whether this machine's DNS server lets c-ares refuse `UNRESOLVABLE` at once
as the OS does; where it does not, the `refuses_unknown_names` fixture skips a c-ares test of that
name and names the reason.
