"""Regression: the audit log recorded new passwords in plain text.

Fix `d3dde3609` (#31622): with request auditing on, the logged request body was
masked only for a field named exactly `password`, so `new_password` (a user changing their own
password), the LDAP `app_dn_password` and the YaCy `YACY_PASSWORD` were written to the audit
log as typed. Any JSON field whose name ends in `password`, in any letter case, is now replaced
with asterisks before the entry is logged; the rest of the request still is.

Fix `3ef0d1543` (#31659): the mask stopped at the first double quote, so a password holding one
was logged from that quote on, and a body with whitespace before the colon was not masked at all.
Response bodies were logged unmasked, so the LDAP settings, which come back with the application
password in them, put it in the log on every save and every read. The mask now runs to the
closing quote, allows whitespace around the colon and covers responses as well.

Since 24e30d1cb the audit log keeps no request or response body for the sign-in routes under
`/api/v1/auths` (the password change, adding a user, the LDAP settings), only that the call
was made; the mask is checked on the admin reset and the retrieval settings, which still log
their bodies.

The tests run on an instance of their own with request and response auditing on, reads
included and bodies kept whole, and read the audit log file in its data directory.

Discriminates: passes on dev b859124f9; with the masking pattern reverted to the exact
`"password"` field the YaCy test goes red (the new value is in the log). With `3ef0d1543`
reverted the double quote, spaced colon and retrieval response tests go red. With bodies
captured again under `/api/v1/auths` the self-service change, add-user and LDAP tests go red.
