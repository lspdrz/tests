"""A terminal connection serves nobody while disabled and only the admin while ungranted.

Two fixes in 0.11.0. `753798923`: switching a terminal connection off only hid it from the list;
anyone who knew its id kept using it through the HTTP proxy and the interactive WebSocket. The
fix refuses a disabled connection on every entry point. `867006acc` (PR #27581, issues #27580
and #27064): with BYPASS_ADMIN_ACCESS_CONTROL off, a connection without access grants, which is
every connection right after it is added, was refused to everyone including the admin who
created it; the fix makes it admin-only. Each entry point is driven against a fake terminal
server that records whether anything reached it.

A chat with a terminal selected is the fourth entry point. Without Redis every chat rebuilds the
terminal list from the saved connections and leaves disabled ones out, so the gate only shows on
an instance backed by Redis whose cached list still names the terminal: the admin switches it
off through a config import, which saves the connection without rebuilding the cache.

Discriminates: passes on dev bbfa876af; with the proxy and WebSocket `enabled` checks of
753798923 removed the disabled-terminal proxy and session tests fail (the fake terminal gets the
request and the shell; the list filtered before the fix), with the `enabled` check removed from
`get_terminal_tools` the chat on the disabled terminal is offered its tools, and with 867006acc
reverted the admin tests on the no-bypass instance fail on every entry point (403, a 4003 close,
not listed).
