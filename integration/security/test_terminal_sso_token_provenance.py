"""The terminal proxy forwards credentials Open WebUI resolved itself, never ones the caller sent.

Before 0.11.0 a `system_oauth` terminal connection took its token from the caller's
`x-oauth-access-token` request header and forwarded it to the terminal server as the Bearer
token, so any signed-in user could present a token that was never issued to them. Fix
`3a9b9a1a7` (PR #26719) resolves the token server-side from the caller's own OAuth session
and ignores the header. Each test proxies one request through a fake terminal server and
reads what it received. The positive half runs on an instance that signs in through a fake
OpenID Connect provider, so the caller holds a real OAuth session whose access token the
terminal must get.

Discriminates: passes on dev ef67cc3fa, fails with 3a9b9a1a7 reverted (the forged header
reaches the terminal server as `Authorization: Bearer forged-by-the-caller`, and the SSO
caller's own session token never does).
