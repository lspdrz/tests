"""Regression: an account whose access was revoked still got a channel's or note's live updates.

Fix `e93a59f4d` (0.11.5): a socket joins the rooms of the channels and notes its account may
read (`channel:{id}` through `user-join`, `note:{id}` through `join-note`, `doc_note:{id}` when
the editor opens the note), and nothing made it leave them again. Once the owner took the grant
away, the open tab still got every new channel message, every edit of the note and every
keystroke in its live document. Saving grants that drop someone now makes that account's sessions
leave the rooms. Deleting a channel or note also closes its rooms; that half is not pinned, since
nothing is sent to the room of a deleted channel or note.

Discriminates: passes on dev efe63bd34; with e93a59f4d reverted in a backend copy every revoked
case receives the update after the grant is gone. The kept-reader and admin cases pass on both.
