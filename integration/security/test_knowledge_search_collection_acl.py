"""The model's knowledge-base search lists only knowledge bases the asker can open, on every store.

The builtin `query_knowledge_bases` tool searches the knowledge-base embeddings with
`filter={'knowledge_base_id': {'$in': [...]}}`, the knowledge bases the caller may read, and
reports each hit's name and description. Before commit 1d6d4e6e6 (v0.11.1) eleven bundled vector
backends took that filter and dropped it, so the store answered with every neighbour, forbidden
knowledge bases included: Qdrant sent no `query_filter` in either storage mode and Elasticsearch
only the collection term. The default Chroma store always applied it.

The same search runs on the shared instance (Chroma) and on instances booted on the local Qdrant
stand-in, in both storage modes, and on the Elasticsearch stand-in, each of which applies the
filter it is sent. Pinecone stays a unit test: its client only reaches an index over TLS against
the certificates it ships with, so no local stand-in can answer it.

Twin of unit/security/test_knowledge_search_collection_acl.py, which keeps the audit that no
vector backend ignores a `filter` argument and the Pinecone case.

Discriminates: passes on ef67cc3fa; with the filter dropped from `search` in the Qdrant, Qdrant
multitenancy or Elasticsearch backend the reader is shown the admin's private knowledge base on
that store, and with the `filter` argument removed from the search in `query_knowledge_bases`
on every store.
