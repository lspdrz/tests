"""Regression: an image an engine answers as a link was downloaded without the SSRF-safe session.

Fix `b4ebd0d62` (#31623). When an OpenAI-compatible engine answers a generation or an edit with a
`url` in place of the image bytes, Open WebUI checks the link once with the URL safety check and
then downloads it. The download used the shared session, which follows redirects and never judges
the address it connects to, so a link on an allowed host could lead the server to a host the
operator's `WEB_FETCH_FILTER_LIST` blocks. It now goes through the SSRF-safe session, which checks
the host and the resolved address of every request, redirect hops included. A link on the
configured ComfyUI base URL stays trusted, and a private address is still refused up front.

The instance fetches local pages and blocks `127.0.0.2`: the engine on `127.0.0.1` is allowed and
redirects to a listener on the blocked address, so only the session can refuse the hop.

Discriminates: passes on dev a5bc78300; with the download back on the shared session, the
redirect to the blocked address is followed, the blocked listener is reached and the image is
stored (generation and edit). The refusal without local fetch, the unblocked redirect, the
direct link and ComfyUI rows pass on both.
