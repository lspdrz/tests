"""Regression: web fetch address checks, the Playwright loader's scope, and web loaders that pace.

`1717b49` (v0.11.0) made the web fetch guard pull out the IPv4 address an IPv6 address carries
(IPv4-compatible `::a.b.c.d`, NAT64 `64:ff9b::/96`, mapped, 6to4, teredo) and judge it as well.
v0.10.2 asked `ipaddress.is_global` alone, which CPython 3.11 answers True for `::7f00:1` and
`64:ff9b::7f00:1`, so a URL on either literal passed the check and the instance connected to it.
A URL that cannot be read is a 400 either way, so the tests read the log line naming the
refused address.

`1e0ab8471` (#27528, issue #26079) unshadowed the `time` module in the web loader. `from datetime
import datetime, time, timedelta` made pacing call `datetime.time.sleep`, which raised inside
each URL's `try`, so every paced page after the first was dropped and logged as an SSL
verification failure. Microsoft Web IQ is the engine whose search path runs that pacing.

Public addresses, IPv6 ones embedding a public IPv4 included, still pass the guard: an external
web loader behind web search is handed exactly the URLs the guard let through, so the check is
seen without the instance fetching a public host.

`bef63a2` (v0.11.0) rewrote the Playwright loader's route hooks. v0.10.2 waved through every
request that was not the page itself, and with `AIOHTTP_CLIENT_ALLOW_REDIRECTS` on let the
browser follow a redirect chain unchecked, so a public page could pull an internal target as a
sub-resource or redirect to one. Now the loader fetches every request and every hop itself
through the address checks, and opens the page with service workers and websockets blocked.
The instance drives its own headless Chromium here, through an attached link (the synchronous
loader) and web search (the async one); the internal host is a second local service on
127.0.0.2 that the fetch filter list blocks.

Discriminates: passes on dev ef67cc3fa; with `_embedded_ipv4` returning nothing the four
IPv4-compatible and NAT64 cases fail (no refusal logged), with `time` imported from `datetime`
again the paced search returns one page of two, blocking every address that embeds an IPv4 one
fails the public addresses, and in the Playwright loader continuing sub-resource routes,
continuing a redirected page, opening the page without `service_workers='block'` or dropping the
websocket route each let the internal host be reached, and a hop limit of 200 fails the endless
redirect chain.
