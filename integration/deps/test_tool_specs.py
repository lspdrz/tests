"""Dependency smoke: a workspace tool's spec, written by langchain-core.

When an admin saves a Python tool, Open WebUI turns each public method into a pydantic model and
langchain-core's `convert_to_openai_function` turns that model into the function spec the model
is offered: the method's name, the docstring's summary as its description, each parameter's JSON
type with its `:param` text, the choices of a `Literal` and which parameters are required. The
spec is stored with the tool and sent to the model whenever a chat has the tool switched on, and
the call the model makes with it runs the method.

Discriminates: passes on dev ef67cc3fa; in a backend copy whose conversion answers only the
name and description (no `parameters`), both tests fail.
