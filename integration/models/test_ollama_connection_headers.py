"""Regression: an Ollama connection's headers and sign-in only reached the server on chats.

Fix commit `bc2416c5d` (open-webui/open-webui#29868) moved the header builder the OpenAI
connections use into a shared helper and has the Ollama model list, the loaded-model list, the
version check and the admin's connection check call it too. Before it those requests carried
only the connection's key as a bearer token: the custom headers, the authentication type and
cookie forwarding were applied to chats alone, so an Ollama server behind a gateway such as
Cloudflare Access answered the model list and the check with the gateway's refusal.

The Ollama stand-in records every request, so each test reads what the listing, the version
check and the connection check actually sent.

Discriminates: passes on dev bc2416c5d; with the fix reverted in `routers/ollama.py` the model
list, loaded-model list, version and verify requests carry neither the custom header nor the
forwarded cookie, and the key goes out as a bearer token despite `auth_type: none`; the chat
test passes on both.
