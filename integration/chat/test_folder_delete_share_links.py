"""Regression: deleting a folder with its chats left the share links of those chats working.

Fix `ffe21bef8` (open-webui/open-webui#31306, issue open-webui/open-webui#31305): deleting a
folder together with its contents removed the chats and their messages but not their shared
snapshots, so everyone holding a share link could still open a conversation its owner had
deleted. The share rows of those chats now go with them. Deleting one chat, or all chats, already
removed the shares; those routes are pinned here too, as is a folder deleted without its
contents, whose chats and shares stay.

Discriminates: passes on dev efe63bd34; with ffe21bef8 reverted in a backend copy both folder
tests with contents fail (the share still opens). The other tests pass on both.
