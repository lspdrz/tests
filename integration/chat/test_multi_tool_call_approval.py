"""Regression: with tool approval on, only the first of several tool calls in one turn was asked.

Fix `35dda256f` (open-webui/open-webui#31315, issue open-webui/open-webui#29293): when the model
called several tools in one turn, the approval pause made the first call `pending` and queued
the others only while they were still streaming. By the time it ran every call was already
complete, so the second and later calls were neither pending nor queued: they never got an
approval card, never ran, answered "already resolved" when approved, and the model was called
again without their results. Every unanswered call is now queued and asked in turn.

Discriminates: passes on dev efe63bd34; with 35dda256f reverted in a backend copy both
multi-call tests fail (the second call never waits for approval). The single-call test passes on
both.
