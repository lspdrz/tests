"""A stop reaches the reply through Redis, after a Redis restart and on a Redis Cluster too.

With Redis configured, stopping a reply publishes a command on a Redis channel and every
instance's task command listener cancels the reply it runs. Three fixes keep that listener alive:

* #27104 (issue #26779): a default socket timeout cut the listener's idle subscription every
  few seconds; `REDIS_SOCKET_TIMEOUT` now defaults to unset. The pinned redis-py no longer
  applies a socket timeout to a subscription's blocking read, so the default is pinned where it
  still shows: a Redis that answers slowly is waited for. Every signed-in request asks Redis
  whether its token was revoked and lets the request through when that fails, so a read that
  gave up shows as a signed-out token accepted.
* bf3a58dbcd (#28909): the listener subscribed once, so after a Redis restart no instance heard a
  stop again. It now subscribes again whenever its stream ends, backing off while Redis is down.
* a5ea8b0b8 (PR #29165, issue #19840): on a Redis Cluster the listener asked for a subscription
  before the cluster client had learned the slot layout, so it never subscribed and a stop was
  dropped while the reply ran to the end. It now initializes the client first. The pinned
  redis-py 8.0.1 subscribes on an uninitialized cluster client as well, so the cluster test is
  journey coverage here and unit/chat/test_socket_cluster_and_packets.py keeps the narrow guard.

One instance runs on a real Redis the test can stall (`DEBUG SLEEP`), stop and start again,
another on a one-node Redis Cluster. The subscription is read off Redis itself (`PUBSUB NUMSUB`),
and a stop is proven by a slow reply that ends before its last piece.

Twin of unit/chat/test_socket_runtime.py, unit/chat/test_socket_and_redis_runtime.py and
unit/chat/test_socket_cluster_and_packets.py for the listener.

Discriminates: passes on dev ef67cc3fa; with a fixed 2 second default socket timeout the
signed-out token is accepted while Redis stalls; with the listener returning once its stream
ends, the restarted Redis never gets its subscriber back and the stop is lost. Removing the
`initialize()` call stays green with redis-py 8.0.1 (see above).
