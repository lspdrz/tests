"""What Open WebUI sends the model provider, read off the provider's own request log.

Nine 0.11.1 fixes land on the request body that reaches the provider:

* #28292 (`ff74bfa6a1`, `d22bb6703f`): memory context rendered rows in arrival order, so the
  system prompt changed between turns and prefix caching missed. Sections are now sorted.
* #28241 (`11739a2de8`): a `custom_params` entry on the request replaced every custom param of
  the global defaults instead of merging with them.
* PR #27661 (`fcc130c9b`): only the web client asked for `stream_options.include_usage`, so
  every other caller of a usage-capable model got no token counts.
* `a32a17965c`: replayed history kept its bookkeeping keys (`id`, `usage`, ...).
* `b6dc70c93b`: an Anthropic thinking block without its signature was replayed and rejected;
  reasoning details nested under `provider_specific_fields` were never captured.
* PR #28788 (`2e7df5467`): an attached chat carries an id and no url, so the url filter dropped
  it from `<attached_files>`.
* #28590 (`0b27fa5e87`): llama.cpp's `cache_n` was added on top of a `prompt_tokens` that
  already includes it, compacting a 39k chat as if it held 77k.
* #27603 (`5093a99389`): compaction ran on the configured task model, not the chat's own.
* #28240 (`c4b3e6840f`): the stored model of a reply was dropped on reload, so a previous
  model's provider-bound reasoning was replayed to whatever model came next.
* `3258330729`: the reasoning format of a replayed reply was keyed on a `provider` field Ollama
  models never carry. Each provider now gets stored reasoning in its own field: `thinking` for
  Ollama (pinned in integration/chat/test_ollama_chat.py), `reasoning_content` for llama.cpp
  and none for a strict OpenAI-style provider.
* #28292 (`ff74bfa6a1`): memories sharing a timestamp came back from search in row order; every
  memory sort now breaks ties on the memory id. One update call stamps all its memories with the
  same second, which is how the ties are made.
* PR #27661 (`fcc130c9b`): the usage capability is read before the custom-model fallback
  (`ENABLE_CUSTOM_MODEL_FALLBACK`, an instance of its own) swaps in the default model, so a
  custom model on the fallback still gets token counts by its own capability.

Stored history is created through the chats API and continued the way the web client
continues a chat, so the server rebuilds the payload from what it stored.

Twin of unit/chat/test_provider_payload_assembly.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev bbfa876af and ef67cc3fa. The narrow tests fail with memory sections in
row order, `custom_params` splatted, the include_usage block removed, only `output` stripped from
replayed messages, the thinking-signature filter removed, the other-model reasoning strip removed,
provider-nested reasoning details ignored, chat attachments filtered by url, `cache_n` added to
`prompt_tokens`, and compaction sent to the task model; dropping `model` from the replay keys fails
the two same-model replay cases. `think_tags` as the default reasoning format fails the llama.cpp
and strict-provider tests, `memory.id` dropped from the sort keys fails both tie tests, and the
capability read moved below the fallback swap fails the fallback usage test.
