"""Chats that are never saved are not offered the task-list tools, and a reply reloads mid-stream.

0.11.0 `d484a2a`, `d2936c8`, `b45c020` and `71c4da8` (issue #27432): call sites open-coded
`startswith(('local:', 'channel:'))` and never learned the `temporary:` prefix the web client
now gives temporary chats. `get_builtin_tools` therefore offered `create_tasks` and
`update_task` to a temporary chat, whose task state has no chats row to live on.
`utils/chat_id.is_saved_chat_id` is now the single answer, and only a saved chat gets them; a
model answering in a channel does not either.

0.11.0 `aadab2f`: `create_task` minted its own task id, while the reply streamed its progress
under the id `chat_completion` had stamped into the turn. A chat opened while its reply was
still streaming looks its running tasks up by the registered id, so it found no progress and
showed an empty reply until the end. `create_task` now registers the caller's id.

Twin of unit/chat/test_socket_and_redis_runtime.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev bbfa876af and ef67cc3fa; with the task-list gate keyed on the `local:`
and `channel:` prefixes again, the `temporary:` chat is offered both tools; with `create_task`
ignoring the id it is handed, or `chat_completion` not handing it over, the reloaded chat shows no
progress while the reply streams.
