"""Regression: a reply stopped or broken before any text kept its chat unusable.

Fix 743a46bdc (PR #31892, issue #25083) skips every empty assistant message when the chat is
replayed to the model. Before, only an empty reply that carried an error was skipped, so a reply
stopped before its first token, or one that ended without text or error, went back to the provider
as an empty assistant message on every later turn, and providers that refuse those refused the
chat for good.

Discriminates: passes on dev b859124f9, fails with 743a46bdc reverted (the empty reply is replayed
as `("assistant", "")` between the two questions).
