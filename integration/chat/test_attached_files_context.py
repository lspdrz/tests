"""Regression: attached files moved to the wrong message after compaction or a tool approval.

Commit af6b82a18 (issue open-webui/open-webui#31411). With native function calling each user
message sent to the model starts with an `<attached_files>` block naming the files uploaded with
it. The block was built by pairing the request's user messages with the stored chat's user
messages by position. Once context compaction dropped the oldest turns, the kept messages were
paired with the dropped ones, so a new upload was announced with an older message's file id or
not at all. The request sent after a tool approval was rebuilt from the database without the
block, so the model lost the file ids mid-turn. The block is now built from each message's own
files, on the first request and on the one after an approval.

Discriminates: passes on dev ef67cc3fa; with af6b82a18 reverted in a backend copy the compacting
turn, the turn after the checkpoint, both approval tests and the compaction-then-approval test
fail (a message lists another message's file, or none). The uncompacted, several-files and
own-tools cases pass on both.
