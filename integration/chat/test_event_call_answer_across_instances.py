"""Regression: a tool's question to the user timed out when their tab was on another instance.

PR open-webui/open-webui#31620 (288bf91f7): with `WEBSOCKET_MANAGER=redis` an instance started
listening on Redis only when the first socket connected to it. A tool asking the user something
(`__event_call__`, an input or a confirmation) sends the question through Redis to the instance
holding the user's tab, and the tab's answer comes back the same way; an instance no tab had
connected to yet never heard it, so the tool waited until the event call timed out. Every instance
now subscribes at startup.

Two instances share one database and one real Redis. The tab connects to one of them only; the
chat is sent to the other, which no socket ever reaches in this module. The event call timeout is
cut to a few seconds so the unfixed ref fails fast. Nearby, the same question answered by a tab
on the instance the chat runs on.

Twin of e2e/chat/test_event_call_answer_across_instances.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev a5bc78300, fails with 288bf91f7 reverted (the chat instance never
subscribes, so the tool gets the event call timeout in place of the answer).
