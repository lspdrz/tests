"""Regression: citations from the knowledge search tools carried no relevance scores.

Fix PR open-webui/open-webui#31307 (merged as `1c813902e`, issue open-webui/open-webui#29776)
in `utils/middleware.py`. With native function calling, `query_knowledge_files` and
`query_chat_files` return a distance per chunk, but the step that groups a tool's chunks into
the reply's citation sources dropped it, so those citations never showed the relevance
percentage that classic retrieval shows for the same knowledge base. Each grouped source now
carries a `distances` list aligned with its documents.

The scripted model calls each tool and the test reads the sources stored on the reply, which is
what the citation list renders after a reload.

Twin of e2e/tools/test_knowledge_tool_citation_scores.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev bc2416c5d; with the fix reverted the stored sources of both tools
have no `distances`; the file-and-text and empty-search tests pass on both.
