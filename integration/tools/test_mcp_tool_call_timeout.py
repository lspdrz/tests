"""Regression: an MCP tool call that hung kept the chat waiting past the tool server timeout.

PR open-webui/open-webui#31641 (c1f245845, issue #31640): a tool call to an MCP server had no time
limit of its own, so a server that never answered kept the chat waiting until a proxy or the
server closed the connection, even with `AIOHTTP_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_TOOL_SERVER` set. The call now
stops after that many seconds (falling back to `AIOHTTP_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`) and the model is told the
tool failed, the way an OpenAPI tool server's call already ends.

The MCP server's `ponder` tool waits as long as it is asked to. An instance with a two-second
limit, and one with only the general client timeout at two seconds, get a call that would take
far longer. Nearby: a call inside the limit still answers, a call on an instance with neither
variable set is left to finish, and an OpenAPI tool server that hangs is cut off at the same limit.

Discriminates: passes on dev a5bc78300, fails with c1f245845 reverted (the MCP call runs to the
end, so the model gets the tool's late answer and both limited cases go red).
