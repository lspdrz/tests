"""Regression: a personal terminal's skills and AGENTS.md never reached the model.

Fix `7ad0ae468` (issue open-webui/open-webui#30410): a personal terminal is one the browser talks
to, such as Open Terminal on the user's own machine, which the server usually cannot reach. The
server still fetched its skill list, its skills and the AGENTS.md in its home folder itself, so
they were silently missing whenever only the browser could reach the terminal. The server now
asks the user's open tab to read them (`request:terminal` on the tab's socket), the way it runs
the terminal's tools.

The tab here is a socket client answering those requests; the terminal's address is one nothing
listens on, as a machine behind the user's router looks from the server.

Discriminates: passes on dev efe63bd34; with 7ad0ae468 reverted in a backend copy (3f5881c52,
which touches the same lines, undone first) all three narrow tests fail: the server connects to
the terminal itself and the chat ends in a connection error. The admin-terminal test passes on
both.
