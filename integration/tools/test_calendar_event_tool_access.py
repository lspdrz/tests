"""Regression: the chat tools that change or delete a calendar event skipped the access check.

Fix `52533c567` (#31537) makes `update_calendar_event` and `delete_calendar_event` check the event's
calendar the way the calendar API does: its owner and admins pass, anyone else needs a write grant
on the calendar. Before, whoever had created the event passed without any grant (a writer whose
access was withdrawn kept editing and deleting their old events), and the calendar's owner was
asked for a grant like everyone else (so they could not change an event a writer created).

Discriminates: passes on dev a5bc78300, fails with the fix reverted (a writer whose grant was
withdrawn still changes and deletes the event they created, and the owner is refused on an event
a writer created).
