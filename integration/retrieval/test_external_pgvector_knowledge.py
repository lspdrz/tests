"""External knowledge: a pgvector table the admin connects, searched from a test and a chat.

The admin tries a query against a table in a Postgres database and adds one collection of it as a
read-only knowledge base; a chat with the knowledge base attached searches that collection with
the embedded question and hands the nearest rows to the model. The database is a real Postgres
with the vector extension, filled with rows in Open WebUI's own table layout, so the tests read
what the search returned rather than what a fake was asked. A pgvector connection keeps no
credentials of its own (they belong in the database URL) and the source needs a vector field.

Discriminates: red on dev 176d31d1d, where the query embedding reaches Postgres as a float array
and every search fails (open-webui/open-webui#26663, fix in #31112); the search tests pass once it
is sent as a vector. In a backend copy with that fixed, filtering on the other collections turns
the unsaved-connection and chat tests red (the other rows come back), ordering by descending
distance turns the two route tests red, keeping the key of a pgvector connection turns the
credentials test red, dropping the vector field check turns the refusal test red, accepting any
character in a table name turns the odd-name test red and reading a schema-qualified name as one
identifier turns the schema test red.
