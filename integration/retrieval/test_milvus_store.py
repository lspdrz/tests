"""Regression: a file is stored in Milvus through `MilvusClient`, even where a scalar index fails.

- open-webui PR #26911 (`f4a6ea930`): the Milvus stores moved from pymilvus's ORM API
  (`Collection`, `connections`, `utility`) to `MilvusClient`. Uploading a file and reading it
  back through retrieval covers the new calls end to end, in both store layouts.
- PR #27521 (`a15e44a5f`, issue #26978): the multitenant store's shared collections carry a
  `resource_id` scalar index. It was created without a type, which Milvus Lite and older servers
  refuse, and the refusal escaped collection creation, so no file could be stored at all. The
  store now retries with an explicit INVERTED index and never fails creation over it.

Milvus is played by `harness.milvus_server`, which can refuse an untyped scalar index the way
those servers do.

Twin of the Milvus part of unit/retrieval/test_document_ingestion.py, which keeps the audit that
neither store imports the ORM API again.

Discriminates: passes on dev ef67cc3fa; without the INVERTED retry (a15e44a5f reverted) the
refused-index case fails (the file is marked failed and nothing is stored); the other cases pass
on both.
