"""Regression: uploads and hybrid search failed on Qdrant with strict mode enabled.

Two fixes for issue open-webui/open-webui#31459:

- Paged reads (8a90f0fc9, open-webui/open-webui#31461). Open WebUI read collections from Qdrant
  in one scroll asking for 999,999,999 points. Strict mode caps that with `max_query_limit` and
  answers "Limit exceeded", so in the default multitenancy mode every upload after the first
  failed its duplicate check, a second file could not join a knowledge base, and hybrid search,
  which reads the whole collection, found nothing. Reads now go in pages of 1,000 points.
- Fallback (eda8d8536, open-webui/open-webui#31460). With hybrid search on, a collection that
  could not be read was skipped quietly, so a chat got no documents and never fell back to
  vector search. Such a collection now counts as failed, and the chat falls back.

Qdrant is the local stand-in from harness/qdrant_server.py, which refuses a scroll or query over
its `max_query_limit` the way strict mode does. Both storage modes are run.

Discriminates: passes on dev efe63bd34. With 8a90f0fc9 reverted the stand-in refuses the
999,999,999-point scroll: the upload and knowledge base tests fail in multitenancy mode (the
other mode swallows the refused duplicate check) and both hybrid search tests fail in either
mode. With eda8d8536 reverted the fallback test fails in both (the model gets no chunk).
