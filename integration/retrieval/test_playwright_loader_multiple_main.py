"""Regression: the Playwright loader returned only the site menu for a page with two `<main>`s.

Issue #28643, fix `4ef7e35b8` (#31644): the HTML parser behind the loader keeps the first `<main>`
of a page and drops the rest, so a page whose first `<main>` holds the site menu and a later one the
content came back as its menu alone. When a page has more than one `<main>` the loader now unwraps
them and reads the whole page. A page with a single `<main>` still loads only that element.

The instance runs its own headless Chromium, as in test_v0114_playwright_media_skip, and loads a
local page through both loaders: the synchronous one behind an attached link and the async one
behind web search.

Discriminates: passes on dev 015dbc861; with the unwrapping call removed from both loaders in a
backend copy the page with two `<main>` elements loads as its menu alone. The single `<main>` case
passes on both.
