"""External knowledge: a Qdrant or Milvus collection the admin connects, searched by test and chat.

The admin saves a Qdrant connection, tries a query against a collection and adds that collection
as a read-only knowledge base; a chat with the knowledge base attached searches it with the
embedded question and hands the points it found to the model. A local service plays Qdrant, so
the tests read the vector query it got and the context the model was sent. A Milvus collection
is searched the same way through a local gRPC service, from the column names the source names, with
the connection's token and database; a Milvus source without a vector column is refused. The admin
also reads, renames, health-checks and deletes a connection, whose key never comes back and
survives an update that leaves it out; a connection a knowledge base uses is kept. A user is
refused every external knowledge route, and Qdrant is never queried for them.

Discriminates: fails with the Qdrant branch of `retrieve_external_knowledge_for_connection`
querying `limit=1` (the connection test and the chat each see one point of two). In a backend
copy, `_get_external_auth_config` taking an omitted key as none turns the CRUD test red,
dropping the in-use check from the connection delete turns its test red, and switching
`test_external_knowledge_source` to `get_verified_user` turns the user test red (Qdrant is
queried for the user). With the Milvus search leaving out the database name the Milvus retrieval
test goes red, with its output fields emptied the Milvus chat test does, and with the vector field
no longer required for Milvus the refusal test does.
