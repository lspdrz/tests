"""Regression: what the server reports about a request, in headers, the audit log and its log.

open-webui 0.11.0 fixes, each read where an operator reads it:

* `X-Process-Time` (#27368): the elapsed time was truncated with `int()`, so every sub-second
  response reported `0`.
* Pure-ASGI security headers (#26924, issue #26922): the configured security headers are
  stamped once on the response start, streamed replies included.
* Empty audit exclusion list (#27370, commit 2ef6c76): an emptied `AUDIT_EXCLUDED_PATHS` became
  `['']`, whose alternation matched every path and silently switched auditing off.
* Readable audit bodies (#27369): the audit middleware was registered after compression, so it
  sat outside it and recorded gzip bytes as the response.
* Blocked webhook targets (commit 0671b7a, issue #26975): the URL check shared a try block with
  the POST, so a blocked target logged a full traceback instead of one warning.
* Provider rejections (#27238, issues #27237/#26253): the reason, model and status of an upstream
  refusal never reached the server log.
* Feedback events (commit 300302d): the event read `feedback.rating`, an attribute the model does
  not have, so every feedback event said the rating was None.
* Values in error logs (commit 6aebfd8, #26814): loguru's `diagnose` was left at its default, so
  every logged traceback printed the local variables beside each frame, a user's chat message
  among them. `LOGURU_DIAGNOSE` now switches it on, off by default.
* Transcription chunk order (#27417, issue #27143): a recording over the 20 MB upload limit of
  speech-to-text engines is split into chunks, and their transcripts were joined in the order the
  engine finished them, not the order they were spoken. Splitting runs ffmpeg and ffprobe, so
  that test skips on a host without them.
* Licensed startup (commits 8f77533, 0c7ddbd): the lifespan fetched the license inline, so an
  instance with a `LICENSE_KEY` was not ready until the license server answered or timed out,
  and an unreachable license host raised out of the fetch instead of falling through to the next.
  The license hosts are fixed, so the instance reaches them through a local HTTPS proxy that
  refuses the first host and holds the connection to the second.

The header, audit and webhook tests run on an instance of their own, booted with security
headers, request-and-response auditing, an emptied exclusion list and a legacy `WEBHOOK_URL` on
loopback, which the webhook sender refuses.

Twin of unit/config/test_observability_middleware.py; the pure-ASGI audit of the middleware
stack stays there.

Discriminates: passes on bbfa876af; formatting the process time with `int()` fails the process
time test, reverting 2ef6c76 the audit tests, registering audit after compression the gzip test,
reverting 0671b7a the webhook test, dropping the rejection log line the provider tests, reading
`feedback.rating` again the feedback test, joining chunks with `asyncio.as_completed` the
transcription test, defaulting `LOGURU_DIAGNOSE` to true the traceback
test, fetching the license inline (or awaiting it without a timeout) the readiness test and
letting the first host's error escape the fetch the fall-through test. The header, GET, sign-in
and opted-in diagnose tests pass on both.
