"""Journey: groups nested inside groups, as the admin panel and the member's own lists show them.

An admin puts a group under another when creating it or later by editing it, takes it back to
the top level with a null parent and moves it to another parent. An unknown parent is a 404, an
empty-string parent, a group as its own parent and a move under its own descendant are refused,
and a refused edit leaves the whole tree as it was. Deleting a middle group lifts its subgroups
into its parent, takes its grants and direct memberships with it and leaves the grandchild's
members with what the top group gave and without what only the deleted group gave. The members
view of a group lists the people added to it and the people in its subgroups, each with the
subgroups they come through, and a member's own group list marks every group as direct or
inherited. A group whose sharing is set to Members offers itself to a subgroup's members.

Discriminates: in a backend copy, dropping the cycle check from `validate_parent` turns the
refused-move tests red (a group becomes its own parent and its own descendant's child), making
`delete_group_by_id` leave the subgroups where they were turns both delete tests red (the leaf
keeps a parent that no longer exists), and making `user_group_memberships` ignore
`include_inherited` turns the member list, the Members sharing test and the delete test red (only
direct groups come back).
