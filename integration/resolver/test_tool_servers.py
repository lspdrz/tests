"""Journey: OpenAPI tool servers and terminal servers reached by host name, under both resolvers.

`AIOHTTP_CLIENT_ASYNC_DNS_RESOLVER` decides which resolver every aiohttp connector Open WebUI opens
uses, and each call an admin or a chat makes to a tool server or a terminal opens its own session.
Each test names the service by `localhost`, a hosts-file name for `::1` alone or a hosts-file name
for another local address and expects the same outcome under both resolvers. An OpenAPI tool server
is verified by the admin, its spec loaded when a chat uses it and its operation called by the
model. A terminal server is verified, has its orchestrator policy, lifecycle and refresh proxied,
its files and terminal sessions proxied for the web client, and serves a chat its spec, working
directory, system prompt, AGENTS.md, skills and tool call. A server whose name does not resolve
fails each of those with the same status and message, the resolver's own wording aside, and a chat
that names it still answers. The MCP SDK talks through httpx and the terminal working directory
call of automations is never reached, so neither is covered here.

Discriminates: on dev 176d31d1d, a backend copy whose `env.py` installs a resolver that fails every
lookup when the flag is on turns every c-ares run of a by-name test red and leaves every threaded
run green; the same resolver installed for the flag off does the reverse. A failure test stays green
under a failing resolver by design; it goes red under c-ares on a host whose DNS server replays
cached answers with a stale EDNS cookie, which c-ares drops (the lookup times out).
