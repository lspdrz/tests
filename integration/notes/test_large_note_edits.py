"""Regression: a large paste into a note was lost after a reload.

Issue open-webui/open-webui#26140, fix 914ff1f11 (PR open-webui/open-webui#31893). Every live edit
of a note carries the whole note several times over: the Yjs update and the editor's markdown,
HTML and JSON snapshot. Pasting around 150 KB of text pushed that one socket message past the
Socket.IO server's 1 MB default, so the server dropped the connection, the edit was never stored
and a reload showed the note without it. The server now takes messages up to 16 MiB, the size it
already accepts for a websocket frame.

Discriminates: passes on dev b859124f9, fails on that backend with 914ff1f11 reverted (the large
edit never reaches the note or its live document).
