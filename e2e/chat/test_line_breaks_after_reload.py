"""Regression: single line breaks in chat messages ran together after a reload or on a shared link.

Fix 808b90c03 (PR open-webui/open-webui#31869). Lines separated by one newline showed on separate
lines while chatting, but opening the chat by its URL, reloading it or reading it through a shared
link ran them into one line. The single-newline setting of the markdown renderer was only switched
on once the chat input mounted, so a message drawn before that rendered without it. The renderer
now has it on from the start.

Discriminates: passes on the dev b859124f9 build, fails on that build with 808b90c03 reverted
(the lines of a message opened by URL or shared link share one row).
