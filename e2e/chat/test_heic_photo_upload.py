"""Regression: an iPhone photo (HEIC) reached a vision model as HEIC, which it refused.

Fix `6c322941d` (PR #31649, issue #28411). The chat input converted a photo to JPEG only when
the browser typed it exactly `image/heic`; Firefox types it `image/heif` and some browsers leave
the type empty, so those photos went up unconverted, an empty type even as a document. When the
conversion did run, the JPEG still went up under the HEIC name and type, so the model was told
it was HEIC. A HEIC or HEIF photo is now converted whatever type the browser reports and goes up
as a `.jpg` typed `image/jpeg`. The photo is attached through the chat's Upload Files menu and
the test reads the image the scripted provider was sent.

Discriminates: passes on the 015dbc861 build; with `6c322941d` reverted in the chat input (the
015dbc861 mutation build) both cases go red: the photo goes up under its HEIC name and type.
