"""Regression: the collapsed steps of a reply read "Explored" while the model was still thinking.

Fix commit `19957bc19` (open-webui/open-webui#29531) in the frontend's group of collapsed steps.
The group showed "Exploring" with a spinner only while one of its tool calls was running. Once
the tool call finished and the model went on thinking inside the same group, the header already
read "Explored", so the chat looked stuck until the answer arrived. An unfinished thinking
block in a reply that is still streaming now keeps the group on "Exploring".

The scripted model calls a tool, then thinks for a few seconds before it answers, so the page
shows the finished tool call and the open thinking block together.

Discriminates: passes on the dev bc2416c5d build; with the group's active check back to tool
calls only, the header reads "Explored" throughout the thinking and never "Exploring".
