"""Regression: a tool's question shown in the page never got its typed answer back to the tool.

PR open-webui/open-webui#31620 (288bf91f7): with `WEBSOCKET_MANAGER=redis` an instance started
listening on Redis only when the first socket connected to it. Behind a load balancer a page's
socket and its requests can reach different instances, so the instance running the chat may have
no socket of its own; a tool asking the user something there showed its dialog in the page, but
the typed answer went back through Redis to an instance that was not listening, and the tool
waited until the event call timed out. Every instance now subscribes at startup.

Two instances share one database and one real Redis, and one address splits them: the page's
socket goes to the first and every other request to the second, which no socket ever reaches.
The model only greets the user by the name the tool got back, so the greeting shows exactly when
the answer arrived. The event call timeout is cut to a few seconds so the unfixed ref fails fast.

Twin of integration/chat/test_event_call_answer_across_instances.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev a5bc78300, fails with 288bf91f7 reverted (the answer never reaches
the tool, which gets the event call timeout, so the greeting never shows).
