"""Regression: the Copy Last Code Block shortcut copied the artifacts pane instead.

Fix PR open-webui/open-webui#31613 (issue open-webui/open-webui#31476) in the frontend. The
shortcut clicks the last Copy button carrying the code block marker on the page, and the
artifacts pane's own Copy button carried that marker too. The pane sits after the messages, so
whenever a reply held an HTML block (which opens the pane by itself) the shortcut put the pane's
whole HTML document on the clipboard and not the last code block of the chat.

A reply holds an HTML block and then a Python block, the pane is opened with Preview (it often
opens by itself, but not on every run) and the shortcut is pressed with the clipboard readable.

Discriminates: passes on the dev a5bc78300 build; with the marker put back on the artifacts pane's
Copy button (the mutation build) the clipboard holds the HTML document and the test goes red.
