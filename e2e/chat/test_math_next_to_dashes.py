"""Regression: inline math touching an em dash or an en dash was left as plain text.

Fix 8e03389de (PR open-webui/open-webui#31901). In a reply such as "constants, e, i and 0 in one
equation" written with a dash on each side of the formulas, the formula next to the dash did
not render and showed as "(0)". The math extension only accepts certain characters right before
and after a delimiter (spaces, commas, brackets) and left both dashes out, for `$...$` as well as
`\\(...\\)`.

Discriminates: passes on the dev b859124f9 build, fails on that build with 8e03389de reverted
(the formulas touching a dash show as plain text, so fewer rendered formulas than written).
