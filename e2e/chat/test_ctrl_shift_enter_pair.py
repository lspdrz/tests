"""Regression: Ctrl+Shift+Enter sent the typed message when "Ctrl+Enter to Send" was on.

Issue open-webui/open-webui#31468, fix 41ca360cc (PR open-webui/open-webui#31864). With Enter Key
Behavior set to Ctrl+Enter to Send, the chat input counted Ctrl+Shift+Enter as Ctrl+Enter and
submitted the message as well as running Generate Message Pair, so the model was asked for a
reply the user did not want. The chord now only adds the message and a placeholder reply, and
Ctrl+Enter still sends.

Discriminates: passes on the dev b859124f9 build, fails on that build with 41ca360cc reverted
(the model receives the typed message after Ctrl+Shift+Enter).
