"""Filters as the chat page shows their work: one switched off mid-reply, and an outlet edit.

1. Fix commit `7d694570a` in `utils/filter.py`: the active filters are read once per request and
   kept on it, where every filter stage of a chat turn used to read them from the database
   again. So a filter an admin switches off mid-reply still runs its `stream` stage to the end
   of that reply. Here a second filter's inlet switches it off, which makes the moment exact.
2. Unpinned, no issue filed: an `outlet` filter that edits the reply edits both its `content`
   and the text of its `output` message items, since the chat page renders a reply from its
   `output`. The edit shows live, is stored and still shows after a reload.

Twin of integration/chat/test_filter_context_and_handlers.py (its mid-request cases).

Discriminates: both pass on dev ef67cc3fa. The first fails with 7d694570a reverted in a backend
copy (the reply arrives without the stream mark); the second fails in a backend copy that drops
the outlet's `output` edit (the page shows the unedited reply).
