"""Regression: older unfinished replies kept a loading cursor forever after opening a chat.

Issue open-webui/open-webui#14806, fix 394295ec7 (PR open-webui/open-webui#31895). Opening a
chat only finished the newest reply that never completed, so an older one (from a cancelled
generation, or a turn an earlier version left unfinished) kept spinning and never offered its
Copy and Regenerate buttons. With no generation running, every unfinished reply now shows as
finished on load, except one waiting for the user to answer a tool's question.

Discriminates: passes on the dev b859124f9 build, fails on that build with 394295ec7 reverted
(the older unfinished reply has no Copy or Regenerate buttons).
