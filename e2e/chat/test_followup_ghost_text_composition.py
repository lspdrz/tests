"""Regression: typing with an input method broke in the empty chat input under a follow-up.

Fix PR open-webui/open-webui#31393 (issue open-webui/open-webui#31372) in the chat input. After a
reply the first suggested follow-up sits as grey ghost text in the empty input. The ghost text
was written into the input's own line, so the first keystroke of an input method rebuilt that
line while the word was still being composed: in Chromium typing "ni" and picking the character
left "n" behind. The ghost text is now drawn over the empty input without being written into
it. Tab still accepts the suggestion.

A seeded chat has a reply that carries a follow-up. The composition is driven through the
browser's input protocol, the way a real input method does it.

Discriminates: passes on the dev a5bc78300 build; with the ghost text written into the input
again (the mutation build) the composed character arrives as "n" plus the character.
