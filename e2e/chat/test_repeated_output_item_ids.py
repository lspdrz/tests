"""Regression: a chat whose reply repeats output item ids froze the tab when it was reopened.

Fix commit `8b4d3ac52` (open-webui/open-webui#31838, issue #31837) in the frontend's display items
of a structured reply. Some Responses API providers (OpenVINO Model Server) number their output
items from zero in every response, so a reply that wrote text, called a tool and then answered
was stored with two message items of one id, and showing it locked the tab. Repeated ids are now
renamed when the reply is shown, saved chats included.

One test has the Responses stand-in answer both rounds with the same message id and reload the
chat it made; the other opens a chat stored in that shape. Every wait is bounded, so a frozen
tab fails the test and does not hang the run.

Discriminates: passes on the dev b859124f9 build; in the build with 8b4d3ac52 reverted the
reopened chat never shows its reply (the tab is unresponsive).
