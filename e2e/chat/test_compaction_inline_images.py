"""Regression: an image stored inside a chat made the context usage jump past the threshold.

Fix 95dd3321a (PR #31915, issue #31913). The chat page estimates the context usage it shows in
the Status panel itself, and counted an image kept in the chat record as a base64 data URI as
text: a few hundred kilobytes of picture read as a hundred thousand tokens, far past the
compaction threshold of a chat that is nearly empty. The encoded data is now left out of the
estimate, here as on the server. Twin of integration/chat/test_compaction_inline_images.py.

Discriminates: passes on the dev b859124f9 build, fails on a build with 95dd3321a reverted (the
panel reads "500% 100k/20k").
