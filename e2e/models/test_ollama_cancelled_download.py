"""Regression: cancelling an Ollama model download deleted the model it was downloading.

Issue open-webui/open-webui#31823, fix PR open-webui/open-webui#31824. The cancel handler aborted
the download and then sent a delete for the model, which removed the copy that was already on the
server when the admin was updating it by pulling again. It is the same in two places: the Manage
Ollama dialog's pull (Admin > Settings > Connections) and "Download ... from Ollama.com" in the
model selector. The cancel now only stops the download.

The Ollama stand-in already has the model and holds its pull after the first progress line, so the
admin cancels it in flight; its delete really removes the model. Each test waits for the cancel
toast, which the handler showed only after its delete, then reads what the stand-in was sent.

Discriminates: passes on dev b859124f9; in a frontend build with 6eb0a0b77 reverted, both tests
fail (the stand-in is sent a delete and no longer has the model).
