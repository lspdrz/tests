"""Regression: a private arena model with no access grants was missing from the admin's selector.

Fix 8c34af303 (PR #31858, issue #30013). With `BYPASS_ADMIN_ACCESS_CONTROL` off, an arena model
left Private with no grants was refused to every admin, the one who created it included, so the
model selector never offered it. It is now admin-only: the admin is offered it and can chat with
it, a user is not offered it. Twin of integration/models/test_arena_model_admin_only.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev b859124f9, fails with 8c34af303 reverted (the admin's selector finds
no such model).
