"""Regression: a repeating event running into the first day of the month view was not shown there.

Fix `ad01bca2b` (#31606, issue #31605): the calendar page loads the events of the days it shows,
and the server expanded a repeating event only into occurrences starting inside them. An
occurrence that began the evening before the first day of the month view and ran past midnight
was left out, so that first day showed nothing, while the same event without a repeat was
shown. The server now keeps every occurrence that ends after the range starts.

The browser runs in UTC, as does the account, so the page's range and the server's expansion
agree on midnight.

Twin of integration/models/test_repeating_event_overlap.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev a5bc78300 with its build; with ad01bca2b reverted in the backend the
month view's first day lacks the occurrence that began the Saturday before it.
