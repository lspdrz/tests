"""An account that may have automations, and a way to give it some.

`scheduler` is a fresh admin, since plain accounts need the automations permission. Its
automations are deleted afterwards so none runs on its own later in the session.
`make_automation(owner, ...)` saves an automation the way the Create dialog does; its schedule
starts in 2099, so the scheduler never runs it and only Run now does.
