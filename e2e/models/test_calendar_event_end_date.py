"""A calendar event's end kept its old date when the event was moved to another day, #31302.

Fix commit `6fdbe3ab6` (open-webui/open-webui#31303). The event editor has one date field, for
the start. Saving combined the end time with the end's old date, and only an end that landed
before the new start was repaired (e2e/models/test_calendar_moves_and_recurrence.py pins that
case). So an event moved to an earlier day ended on its old day and spanned the days between,
and a multi-day event moved later by less than its length lost days. The end now moves by
as many days as the start did.

Discriminates: passes on dev efe63bd34; with 6fdbe3ab6 reverted the event moved earlier still
ends a week later and the multi-day event ends a day early; the time-only edit passes on both.
