"""Journey: a document attached in the chat composer that cannot be read says why.

The composer uploads an attachment and follows its processing; when reading it fails, the
reason the server stored is shown as a warning. On an install without the pandoc program, a
reStructuredText file (which unstructured converts through pypandoc) names the missing program,
and a PDF that needs a password to open (which pypdf cannot decrypt) says so. Twin of the
pandoc and password cases in integration/deps/test_document_extraction.py.

Discriminates: on dev ef67cc3fa, in a backend copy that no longer maps pypandoc's "No pandoc was
found" error to the pandoc message, the .rst warning shows the raw error and the test fails;
with the loader opening a locked PDF with its owner password the PDF is read without a warning.
