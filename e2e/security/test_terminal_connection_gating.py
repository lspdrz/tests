"""A terminal switched off while a chat has it selected hands that chat no tools.

Fix `753798923` (0.11.0) refused a disabled terminal connection on every entry point that
resolves one by id, where before only the list had hidden it. A user picks a terminal from the
chat input's Terminal menu; the admin then switches it off through a config import, which saves
the connection without rebuilding the terminal list cached in Redis. The user's next message
still names the terminal, and the reply shows that it is disabled instead of the model being
offered its tools.

Discriminates: passes on dev ef67cc3fa with its built frontend; with the `enabled` check removed
from `get_terminal_tools` in a backend copy the model is offered the terminal's tools and the
reply shows no error.
