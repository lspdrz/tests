"""Regression: cloning a chat in a folder shared for writing moved the clone out of the folder.

Fix `d4d04dca0` (#31370, issue #31369): Clone in a chat's sidebar menu goes through the chat
import, which kept the chat's folder only when the user owned it. For a chat of theirs in a
folder another account shares with them for writing, the clone landed at the root of their chat
list. The import now keeps any folder the user may write to.

Twin of integration/security/test_fork_chat_folder_access.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev a5bc78300 with its build; with d4d04dca0 reverted in the backend the
shared folder does not list the clone and the stored clone has no folder.
