"""Regression: a failed Read Aloud playback left the speaker button stuck in "speaking".

Issue open-webui/open-webui#30262, fix 7924ce7d7 (PR open-webui/open-webui#30373). The audio
queue ignored a rejected `play()`, so when the browser refused to play the speech (as iOS does
for playback started outside a tap) its state never reset: the button stayed in "speaking", no
error showed and the next tap only stopped a playback that never started. A rejected playback
now resets the queue, returns the button to idle and shows "Audio playback failed". The iOS
unlock itself needs WebKit on a device and is not covered here.

Discriminates: passes on the dev efe63bd34 build, fails on that build with 7924ce7d7 reverted
(no error shows and the second tap asks for no speech).
