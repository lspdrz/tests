"""Regression: a voice call hung in "speaking" with no sound when text-to-speech failed.

Issue open-webui/open-webui#30052, fix 24c01bd76 (PR open-webui/open-webui#30372). When the
speech provider failed during a call, the failed sentence never reached the audio cache and the
playback loop queued it again every 200 ms, forever. The overlay stayed on "Tap to interrupt",
showed no error and ignored the microphone until tapped. A failed sentence now marks its reply
as failed: the provider's error shows once, and the call goes back to listening.

Discriminates: passes on the dev efe63bd34 build, fails on that build with 24c01bd76 reverted
(no error shows and the call never takes the next turn).
