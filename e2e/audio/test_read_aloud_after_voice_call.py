"""Regression: Read Aloud stayed silent after a Voice mode call had ended.

Issue open-webui/open-webui#31874, fix 35b0db7ed (PR open-webui/open-webui#31875). Read Aloud and
Voice mode play through one hidden audio element on the chat page. Ending a call mutes it, and
the Read Aloud player never unmuted it, so every reply read aloud after a call played with no
sound until the page was reloaded. The player now unmutes the element before each sentence.

Discriminates: passes on the dev b859124f9 build, fails on that build with 35b0db7ed reverted
(Read Aloud plays on an audio element that is still muted).
