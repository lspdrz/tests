"""Regression: a large paste into a note was gone after a reload.

Issue open-webui/open-webui#26140, fix 914ff1f11 (PR open-webui/open-webui#31893). The note editor
sends every edit over the socket with the whole note in it several times over (the Yjs update
and the markdown, HTML and JSON of the editor). Pasting a couple of hundred KB of text made that
message larger than the server's 1 MB cap, so the live connection dropped and reconnected and
the paste was never saved: the editor showed it until the page was reloaded. The server now
takes messages up to 16 MiB. Twin of integration/notes/test_large_note_edits.py.

The text goes through the browser clipboard and Control+V, as a person pastes it.

Discriminates: passes on dev b859124f9, fails on that backend with 914ff1f11 reverted (the paste
is never stored and the reloaded note is empty).
