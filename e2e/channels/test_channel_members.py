"""Journey: an owner adds and removes channel members and a private channel stays closed.

The member list opens from the user count in the channel header. The owner sees "Add Member" and
a remove button per person; a plain member sees neither. Adding someone by name shows a toast and
raises the count, after which the new member can open the channel and read what was said before.
Removing someone lowers the count, and that person is sent home when they open the channel, as is
anyone who was never in it, and the channel is not in their sidebar.

Discriminates: passes on dev 176d31d1d; in a frontend copy, adding nobody on submit turns the add
test red, removing the wrong person turns the remove test red, offering the manager buttons to
every member turns the plain member test red, and staying on the channel page when it cannot be
loaded turns the outsider tests red.
