"""Regression: a failed SSO sign-in tells the person the identity provider failed.

`6a2aad92f` (#31629, issue #31627): when the provider let the person through but the account had
no email, the sign-in page said the email or password was wrong, though the person typed neither.
Walking "Continue with SSO" to such a failure now lands back on the sign-in page with a message
that asks them to contact their administrator and never blames the email or password.

Twin of integration/auth/test_sso_sign_in_failure_message.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev a5bc78300; with the fix reverted in a backend copy (the frontend
build stays clean) the sign-in page shows the email/password message instead. The good sign-in
passes on both and is the control.
