"""Regression: the Daily Messages chart vanished for All time once a message had no timestamp.

Fix f25708484 (PR #31888, issue #27316). A message row stored without a time failed the Daily
Messages request for All time with a 500, so the dashboard showed its other figures and no chart.
Such a row now counts on today.

One fresh user has a reply from ten days ago and one whose time is gone; the dashboard narrowed
to that user's group shows neither for the last 7 days and both, with a chart starting ten days
ago, for All time.

Twin of integration/models/test_analytics_missing_timestamp.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev b859124f9, fails with f25708484 reverted (All time shows "2 messages"
and no Daily Messages chart).
