"""The analytics tab of the admin settings could not be scrolled, #30428.

Fix commit `d66e5dc40` (open-webui/open-webui#30429). The analytics dashboard renders inside the
settings modal, whose tab area clips what overflows it. The other tabs scroll inside their own
area; the analytics one had none, so the lower rows of the model and user tables were cut off
and the wheel moved nothing. It scrolls like the other tabs now.

Discriminates: passes on dev efe63bd34; with d66e5dc40 reverted the wheel leaves the end of the
dashboard out of view.
