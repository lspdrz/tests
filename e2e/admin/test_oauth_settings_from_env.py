"""Regression: the admin panel showed OAuth sign-up off although the environment turned it on.

open-webui fix `e398ba350` (#26928). A boot with `ENABLE_OAUTH_PERSISTENT_CONFIG` off stored
every SSO setting anyway, and once the operator turned persistence on those stale rows won over
the environment, so the authentication page kept showing (and the server kept using) the old
value. The checkout is booted once with persistence off, then again with it on and OAuth sign-up
switched on in the environment, and the admin opens the authentication settings.

Twin of integration/auth/test_oauth_settings_from_env.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev ef67cc3fa, fails with the persistence check removed from
`Config.seed_defaults` (the OAuth Signup switch shows off).
