"""Regression: a citation from the model's knowledge search showed no relevance percentage.

Fix PR open-webui/open-webui#31307 (merged as `1c813902e`, issue open-webui/open-webui#29776)
in `utils/middleware.py`. With native function calling the citations built from
`query_knowledge_files` dropped the distance each chunk came back with, so opening one showed
the cited text without the relevance badge that classic retrieval shows for the same knowledge
base. A person reads the badge in the citation dialog.

Twin of integration/tools/test_knowledge_tool_citation_scores.py.

Discriminates: passes on dev bc2416c5d; with the fix reverted in a backend copy and the dev
build unchanged, the citation dialog shows the text with no relevance percentage.
