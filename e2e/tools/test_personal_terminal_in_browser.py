"""Regression: the AGENTS.md of a terminal added in a user's own settings never reached the model.

Fix `7ad0ae468` (issue open-webui/open-webui#30410): a personal terminal is one only the user's
browser may be able to reach, such as Open Terminal on their own machine. The server fetched its
AGENTS.md and skills itself; now it asks the open tab (`request:terminal` on its socket) and
the page reads them from the terminal and answers. This drives that page half: the terminal is a
local fake the page calls across origins, and the test checks the browser read the file and the
model got it. Browser twin of integration/tools/test_personal_terminal_through_browser.py.

Discriminates: passes on the efe63bd34 build; on a build with the page's `request:terminal`
handler removed the test fails (the page never reads the terminal and the model is sent no
AGENTS.md), while an unrelated chat journey passes on that build.
